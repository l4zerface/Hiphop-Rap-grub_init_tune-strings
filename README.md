Hiphop and rap inspired GRUB_INIT_TUNE strings. Wu-Tang. Code rules everything around us.

Place the string into /etc/default/grub, use "grub-mkconfig" to regenerate your GRUB configuration file and reboot.

[Note : I have not tested these strings on hardware. They were created using BreadMaker's amazing GRUB_INIT_TUNE tester and were not tested further.]

Please visit the following sites to learn to play and create your own strings:
